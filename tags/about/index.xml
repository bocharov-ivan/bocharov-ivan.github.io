      <description>I am currently working in Signal Processing Systems group at TU/e as a PhD student. My research interests include probabilistic programming language design, variational inference, and audio. I apply techniques and tools from machine learning to model real-world acoustic environments.
I am a big fan of trading (or collectible) card games such as Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone and many others.</description>
