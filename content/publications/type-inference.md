abstract = "The paper describes static type checking methods and algorithm for functional parallel programming language FPTL. FPTL is implemented on multicore systems and is widely used. FPTL is a pure functional language based on function compositions. By function composition we understand the application of four composition operations and recursive definitions. Three of composition operations are parallel. It made possible to implement rather effective algorithms o f parallel pro-gram execution on multicore systems, using program interpretation. This is the key difference between FPTL and other functional languages, based on lambda-notation (such as Haskell, ML, etc.). Language type system consists of built -in types (int, real, bool, etc.) and user-defined abstract types. Functions in FPTL language are in general polymorphic. In theoretical section of this paper rules of correct typing and algorithm of type checking based on these rules are described. In the current language implementation on multicore system correctness of typing is checked while program is being executed. Type checking takes about 30 % of program execution time. Type checking system presented in the paper helps to significantly reduce time of program execution."
