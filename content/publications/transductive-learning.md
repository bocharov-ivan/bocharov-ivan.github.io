abstract = "In many classification problems there are difficulties with obtaining sufficient amount of labeled documents for train set. At the same time, usually we have many unlabeled documents. This paper describes how to increase the quality of classifier predictions when having relatively small train set in comparison with test set. Non-standard method of forming feature vectors for natural language texts, using peculiar properties of news articles, is described. The paper also describes modifications of a classical linear classifier (logistic regression). We use a modification of stochastic gradient descent in order to optimize classifier’s parameters. In addition, we use modified loss functional (enlarging the margin between classes) to train logistic regression. Apart from that, we suggest original method of transductive learning for logistic regression classifier. To perform transductive learning we define quality functional for unlabeled documents which helps to in crease classification recall significantly. To test implemented modifications of logistic regression we use “inverse” cross -validation technique. Experimental results from using implemented modifications make the positive impact of authors’ modifications of logistic regression classifier and transductive learning on classification quality obvious."
